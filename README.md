<h1> Password Generator 🔐</h1>
This project is a Python-based Password Generator that creates secure, random passwords using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It’s an ideal demonstration of efficient Python code and shows my ability to design simple yet functional command-line applications.
<br/>

<h2>Project Overview 📋</h2>
The Password Generator is a compact and effective script designed to provide strong passwords for enhanced security. This project is perfect for situations where passwords need to be generated quickly and programmatically, without user input, making it useful for backend security tasks, password management, and personal use.

## Key Features ✨

- **Customizable Length**: Easily specify the desired password length.
- **High Security**: Uses uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Quick and Lightweight**: A simple script that runs instantly from the command line.
- **Portable**: No external dependencies, only the standard Python library.

<h2>Running the Project 🚀</h2>
To get started with the Password Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 
 - git clone https://github.com/brianmuwaya/Password-Generator.git

 - cd Password-Generator

2. Run the program:

- python password_generator.py

3. The program will output a secure, randomly generated password based on the specified length.


<h2>Technical Skills Demonstrated 🛠️</h2>

- Python Scripting: Writing efficient, modular, and reusable Python code.
- Randomization and Security: Implementing secure password generation techniques using random.
- Command-Line Interface: Building a script that is straightforward to run and adaptable to various use cases


<h2>Potential Improvements 🚀</h2>

Here are a few potential next steps for this project:

1. GUI with Tkinter: Adding a graphical interface for non-technical users.
2. Password Strength Customization: Allowing users to choose character types (letters, numbers, symbols) and define their own rules.
3. File Output Option: Enabling users to save generated passwords to a file.
